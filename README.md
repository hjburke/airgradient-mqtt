## Implementation of the AirGradient DIY Air Quality Sensor publishing to an MQTT broker

This is the code for the AirGradient DIY Air Quality Sensor with an ESP8266 Microcontroller.
It is a high quality sensor showing PM2.5, CO2, Temperature and Humidity on a small display and can send data over Wifi to an MQTT broker.

WiFi and MQTT parameters are entered via a captive WiFi portal and saved to flash using LittleFS.  OTA updates supported.
